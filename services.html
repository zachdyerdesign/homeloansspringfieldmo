                                <p>A <b>mortgage broker</b> acts as an intermediary who brokers <a title="Mortgage loan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan">mortgage loans</a> on behalf of individuals or businesses.</p>
<p>Traditionally, banks and other lending institutions have sold their own products. However, as markets for mortgages have become more competitive, the role of the mortgage broker has become more popular. Today in most developed mortgage markets (especially in <a title="Canada" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>, the <a title="United States" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">U.S.</a>, the <a title="United Kingdom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>, <a title="Australia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>, <a title="New Zealand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a title="Spain" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>), mortgage brokers are the largest sellers of mortgage products for lenders.</p>
<p>Mortgage brokers exist to find a bank or a direct lender that an individual seeks with a specific loan the individual is seeking. Mortgage brokers in Canada are paid by the lender and do not charge fees for good credit applications.</p>
<p>The majority of mortgage brokers are regulated to ensure compliance with banking and or finance laws in the jurisdiction of the consumer; however, the extent of the regulation depends on the jurisdiction. Only one state within the U.S. has no laws that govern mortgage lending.</p>
